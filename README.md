# Jacob Mfune Portfolio Site

This is portfolio site to showcase Jacob's abilities, skills and knowledge in HTML, SCSS and JavaScript as a self-taught Frontend developer looking to get hired.

## Lessons Learned

* Creating dynamic content using JSON and the fetch method to get the content from the JSON file and display it on my HTML using JavaScript DOM Manipulation and iterating over the json data using the map() function to display each item in the object nested in the array.
* Accessibility features like using the aria-label attribute to label items on my site that do not have initial text like my mobile nav menu and social media icons.
* Using JavaScript to make my mobile nav menu have a dynamic interaction with the users by adding an eventListener to open and close the menu.
* Simple CSS rules like scroll-behavior: smooth that solved a problem I had with having my nav links link to sections on the same page jump from one section to another while now there is a smooth scroll up/down from one section to another.
* Using the @forward instead of the import method for SCSS.
* Using meta tags and Semantic HTML for SEO purposes.
