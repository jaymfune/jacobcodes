# Jacob Mfune Portfolio Site

This is portfolio site to showcase Jacob's abilities, skills and knowledge in HTML, SCSS and JavaScript as a self-taught fullstack developer looking to get hired.

The completion of this project has taught me a few things these are some of the challenges and lessons I have learnt so far :
* Accessibility features like using the aria-label attribute to label items on my site that do not have initial text like my mobile nav menu and social media icons.
* Using JavaScript to make my mobile nav menu have a dynamic interaction with the users by opening and closing onclick where I used a eventListener to my nav menu button.
* Simple CSS rules like scroll-behavior: smooth that solved a problem I had with having my nav links link to sections on the same page jump from one section to another while now there is a smooth scroll up/down from one section to another.
